### 👋 Hi there, I’m @anotherme13

💻 I’m a passionate CTF player specializing in:

- 🔍 **Binary Reversing** – digging deep into logic, cracking binaries, and uncovering secrets  
- ⚔️ **Pwnable challenges** – exploiting vulnerabilities, understanding memory corruption, and hacking for fun (and learning!)  

🎯 Currently sharpening my skills in:

- ⛓️ Reverse engineering obfuscated binaries  
- 🛠️ Exploit development & binary exploitation  
- 🧠 Low-level systems knowledge (assembly, ELF internals, debugging)

🌱 I’m also learning more about:

- 🚩 Advanced exploitation techniques  
- 🧬 Static and dynamic binary analysis  
- 📚 Real-world CVEs and exploit writeups

🤝 I'm open to collaborating on:

- 🧩 CTF teams or mini reversing challenges  
- 🔐 Security-related side projects or tools  
- 📝 Technical blog posts or writeups

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy the thrill of solving a reversing puzzle more than sleeping. 😴➡️🔍
